# Introduction to R

R is a __wonderful__ programming language to do statistical alaysis and visualization on your data. In this lecture, I will introduce you to the basic concepts of the R language using the popular graphic interface **RStudio**. Whether you're a total newbie in Data Science (we all once have been!) or you already have some experience but want to refresh your knowledge, this is your place!

## Preparation [to do before the lecture!]

In order to properly follow the lecture, it is highly recommended to have R and RStudio installed. I have made [a short video tutorial](https://youtu.be/t3p6w6O283I) explaining how you can install it on different operative systems.

That's it for now. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to post it in the Discussion page. I hope to see you on Wed 13/01/2021 !
