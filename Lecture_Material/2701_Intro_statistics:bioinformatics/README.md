# Statistics in R + basic Bioinformatics

Hey Everyone! The topic of this lecture will be quite broad. It will be all based on the statistical analysis of some publicly available gene expression data. While analysing these data, we will go through the most relevant statistical methods. In this way, you get to do some bioinformatics while learning/reviewing statistics and R. We will also go through the different visualization methods that we didn't make it to address in the previous lecture due to the lack of time. 

## Outline

1. Descriptive Statistics:
    - Summary of Categorical Variables
    - Visualization of Categorical Variables (Barplot and Histogram)
    - Summary of numerical variables
    - Visualization of numerical variables (QQ plots - normal distribution test, density plots, boxplots)
2. Inferential Statistics:
    - Hypothesis Testing 
    - Correlation analysis (visualization with heatmaps)
    - Basic machine learning: logistic regression Analysis
3. Differential Gene Expression Analysis:
    - t-test
    - Multiple comparison correction
    - Fold change and vulcano plot
