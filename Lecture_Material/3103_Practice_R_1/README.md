# R Practice (Part 1) 

Hi Everyone! 

This lecture will allow you to concretly code in R while doing something more fun. You will get to look through some data about published movies and use the newly learnt R skills to select the 
best movie for you to watch. 

No prior coding experience is necessary!!

While having fun, you will get to learn how to manipulate data and write basic for loops. 
You don't need to install anything. The maaterial is easily accessible at this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EqzuZZlw8ogdpB_yZEuspl6lqHsIwvOP?usp=sharing).

## Outline
1. Import of data
2. Manipulation of dataframe (filtering, variable selection, ordering...)
3. For loops.
