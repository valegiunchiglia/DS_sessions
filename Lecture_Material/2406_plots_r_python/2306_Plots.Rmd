# The R Markdown format

This is an R Markdown document. It is a file format where we can combine code (R) and formatted text (Markdown).
Markdown is a mark-up language to produce HTML documents from a simple plain-text syntax.
Similar to how in whatsapp you can write \***bold text**\* and \_ _italics_ \_ by using \* and \_, you can use them also in Markdown.
For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Rmarkdowns are the R equivalent of jupyter notebooks, 
but the cool thing is that thanks to a recent update in RStudio, we can use python code within an Rmarkdown document!
But more of that in a minute.

# Plotting basics

Plots are graphical representation of data. 
Their main goal is to communicate results in a rapid and compelling way, allowing us to quickly assess and compare data.
Proper plotting has a bit of science and a bit of art and creativity. 
Visually pleasing plots are nicer to see, and while they won't necessarily make the results any clearer, there is also no reason to oppose them :)

# R

## ggplot

`ggplot` is a library for R that helps us in creating high quality graphics. 
Have a look at [their website](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) to access the user guide.
The documentation of every function is thorough and provides very useful examples and additional resources.
My personal tip: check the page from time to time to see if you find something new to learn.

This lecture is about making nice graphics, so I'll be skipping over base R  plotting.
Base is fine if you want a quick plot, but they are very limited in terms of aesthetic.

Just to make my point:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
p1 = ggplot(data = diamonds, 
            aes(x = carat, y = price)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  ggtitle("ggplot default")

p1 + wrap_elements(~plot(diamonds$carat, diamonds$price, main = 'R base default'), clip=FALSE)
par(mar=c(0,2,0,0))
```


## Today's dataset... diamonds ðŸ’ŽðŸ’ŽðŸ’Ž

A brief description of the diamonds dataset can be found by running `?diamonds` in the R console. In summary:

|Variable|Type|Meaning|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|carat|numeric,float|carat weight of the diamond|
|cut|categorical,ordinal|quality of the cut|
|color|categorical,ordinal|color of the diamond, also related to quality (D:best, J:worst)|
|clarity|categorical,ordinal|How obvious inclusions are within the diamond:(in order from best to worst, FL = flawless, I3= level 3 inclusions) FL,IF, VVS1.|
|depth|float|The height of a diamond, measured from the culet to the table, divided by its average girdle diameter |
|table|float|The width of the diamond's table expressed as a percentage of its average diameter|
|price|integer|price in $|
|x, y, x|float|width, height, depth of the diamond, in milimeters|


```{r}
head(diamonds)
```


```{r}
head(penguins)
```

## The grammar of graphics

`ggplot` follows the design principle of the "Grammar of Graphics", which formalizes components of a visualization in a way that generalize many common concepts together.
A common way of plotting a scatter plot in base R is using the syntax `plot(VectorX,VectorY)`, where we ask it to draw specifically that pair of datapoints.
In `ggplot`, however, we don't give direct orders like that. Rather, we give specifications of higher-level instructions that then the `ggplot()` function interprets to produce a graphic.
Let's go step by step.

1. Every ggplot starts by calling the `ggplot()` function
  - It is a way to tell ggplot that we are initializing a figure
1. In the same function call, we can specify the data and some prelimiary instructions
1. Finally, we ask ggplot to plot the data using specific geometric shapes

```{r}
# The diamonds dataset is in the ggplot2 library
ggplot( # call the function
  data = diamonds, # specify what dataset we will use for plotting
  mapping = aes(x = carat, y=price) # instructions on what to use for the plot
) + # we use the + signs to add layers of specification
  geom_point() # among the geometric shapes that could be used, please use points/dots
```

The instructions that we give to ggplot have to be inside the `mapping` argument.
We have to specify it by using the `aes()` â€”aesthethicsâ€” function. 
In the context of ggplot, aesthetics are not just superficial details to make images pretty. 
**Aesthetics are pieces of information that are mapped to visual elements in the plot** (the x axis locaiton, the color, etc.) and are thus a vital component of the plotting process.
Finally, the information supplied to the `ggplot()` has to be expressed as some sort of concrete shape, the `geom_`. 
In the case above, we specify dots with `geom_point()`

> So to sum up, we produce a plot by doing the following steps:

1. call ggplot()
1. tell ggplot what data to use
1. tell ggplot how to map columns to aesthetic elements
1. specify the shape to use in the plot

--------

#### Code with me!

Explore the diamonds dataset!
Can you find any interesting relationship? Whacky distributions?

Try writing in the console the word `geom_` and press Tab. See what suggestions pop up.
Alternative, visit the [ggplot function reference](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/) to see what options you have.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds,
       mapping = aes(x = ..., y = ...)) +
  geom_...
  
```

--------

## Aesthetic mappings

Often we want to use the values of a variable to highlight different groups in our data.
We can do that by mapping that variable to an aesthetic that will provide that information.

In the following example, we want to see the relationship between diamond's carat and its price but also controlling for the diamond's quality (Fair, Good, Premium, etc).
In order to do that, we have to tell ggplot to use the values in the `cut` column to color the dots in our plot.


```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds %>% sample_frac(.1),
       mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) +
  geom_point()
  
```

Overall, the main aesthetics you will usually make use of are:

- color/fill 
- shape
- size
- alpha (transparency)

Just to give you a quick overview of some of them and their uses

```{r}
print(table(penguins$year))
penguins

```


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=5}

p1 = ggplot(diamonds %>% sample_frac(.1),
            aes(x = cut, y = price, fill = cut)) + 
  geom_violin() + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = .1) + 
  labs(x = "", y = "Price ($)", fill = "Cut quality",
       title = "Mapping quality to the :fill: aesthetic")

p2 = ggplot(penguins %>% sample_frac(.5), 
            aes(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, shape=island, color=island)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(x="Bill length (mm)", y="Bill depth (mm)", 
       shape = "Island", color="Island",
       title = "Mapping quality to the :shape: and :color: aesthetic", 
       subtitle = "Data from the Palmer Penguins dataset")

p3 = diamonds %>% sample_frac(.1) %>% 
  group_by(cut, clarity) %>% 
  summarise(avg_price = mean(price)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(cut, clarity, size=avg_price)) +
  geom_point(shape=21, fill='white', stroke=2) +
  labs(x = "Cut quality", y = "Clarity", size = "Average price",
       title = "Mapping the average price of each \ncut-clarity combination to the :size: aesthetic",
       subtitle = "Not a great aesthetic")

# p4 = ggplot(diamonds %>% sample_frac(.1), aes(x, y, alpha = price)) + 
#   geom_point() +
#   labs(x = "Width (mm)", y = "Height (mm)", alpha = "Price ($)",
#        title = "Mapping price to the :alpha: aesthetic")

p4 = ggplot(penguins,
            aes(bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, 
                alpha = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point()

(p1+p2)/(p3+p4)

```

## Fixed aesthetic

Sometimes you want just a fixed  color / shape / size without mapping it to a variable, and that's fine!

```{r}
# we can omit writing data = ... and mapping = ...
# explicitly by writing them in the correct order

ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .05, color = 'navyblue')
```

## Meaningful labels

- Use the `labs` function to specify better label names. Labels can be:
  - The title, subtitle and caption
  - x and y axis labels
  - legend titles for mapped aesthetics (fill, color, shape, etc)
  

```{r}
# we can omit writing data = ... and mapping = ...
# explicitly by writing them in the correct order

ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .05, color = 'navyblue') + 
  labs(title = "Relationship between diamond carat and its price in $",
       subtitle = "The relationship seems to follow and exponential increase",
       caption = "Data provided by the {ggplot} package",
       x = "Weight (carat)", y = "Price ($)")
```

## Themes!

`ggplot` provides some pre-set themes that we can use to change the overall look of the plot.
Explore them by typing `theme_` and pressing Tab

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}

themes = c('theme_bw'=theme_bw, 'theme_classic'=theme_classic, 
         'theme_void'=theme_void, 'theme_minimal'=theme_minimal)
lapply(names(themes), function(theme){
         
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .05) + 
  labs(title = "Relationship between diamond carat and its price in $",
       subtitle = theme,
       x = "Weight (carat)", y = "Price ($)") + 
  themes[[theme]]()
       }) %>% wrap_plots(ncol=2)

```


## Combining plots together

- `patchwork` makes our life easy
- put plots side-by-side with `+`
- put plots on top of each other with `/`

```{r}

```


## Facetting

Use facets to divide your plots into subplots according to data in a column

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, color=sex)) +
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~island)
```


## Tidy data 

```{r}
df = lapply(setNames(nm=LETTERS[1:10]), function(x) rnorm(150)) %>% bind_cols
df %>% 
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to="var", values_to = "vals") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = vals, fill=var)) + 
  #geom_density() + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  facet_wrap(~var)
```


# Python

## Seaborn

My personal recommendation is to use the [seaborn library](https://seaborn.pydata.org/). 
It follows a similar philosophy to that of `ggplot`, although the language is different.

### Figure vs Axes lvl plots

Seaborn has 2 hierarchies of plots: Figure-level and Axes-level

Figure level plots have more generic names, are self-contained objects and should, in principle, be enough to call with just one function.

```{python}
import pandas as pd, numpy as np
import seaborn as sb, matplotlib.pyplot as plt
sb.set_theme()

penguins = r.penguins
f = sb.relplot(data = penguins, 
           x = "bill_length_mm",
           y = "bill_depth_mm", 
           hue = "sex",
           col = "island")

f.set_axis_labels("Flipper length (mm)", "Bill length (mm)") # x, y

plt.show()
```


```{r}
penguins
```


### Subplots and colorbars

```{python}
some_img = np.random.rand(100,100)

f, axarr = plt.subplots(2,3,figsize=(16,12));
f.suptitle('Something')
 
img_plot = axarr[0,1].imshow(some_img, cmap='viridis')
img_plot.set_clim([0,1])
axarr[0,1].axis('off')
axarr[0,1].set_title('Grad-CAM')
f.colorbar(img_plot, ax=axarr[0,1], fraction=0.046, pad=0.05, ticks=np.arange(0,1.1,0.1)) 

axarr[0,2].axis('off')

plt.show()
```
