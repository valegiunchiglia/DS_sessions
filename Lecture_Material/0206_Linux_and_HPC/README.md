# Linux and High Performance Computing Cluster


Hey everyone! In the lecture of today we will talk about how to use linux/the command line and how to work on the HPC. Having a basic konwledge of linux will definitely make your life easier, since somehow you always end up using the terminal at least once in your projects. 

The lecture will be divided into two sections: the first part will be about the basic usage of the terminal and command line, the second one about how to specifically use the HPC.
You don't need to have anything installed to join the lecture. We will help you all out at the beginning!
